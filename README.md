# Traffic Congestion Predictor

## Project Overview
This project predicts traffic congestion patterns in Melbourne using traffic signal volume data. The goal is to understand peak traffic times and provide insights for route optimization, delivery planning, or general traffic analysis.

## Dataset
The original dataset is sourced from **VicRoads Traffic Signal Volume Data**, which contains traffic volumes at signal locations, aggregated in 15-minute intervals. Due to size and licensing restrictions, the full dataset is **not included in this repository**.  

> **Note:** The dataset can be provided upon request for educational or research purposes.
